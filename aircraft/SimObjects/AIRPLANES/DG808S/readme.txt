DG Flugzeugbau DG-808S - originally created by Microsoft glider imported into Microsoft Flight Simulator from Flight Simulator X by MSFS Legacy Importer program.

*Important - you can only use this conversion if you are licensed both for FSX and MSFS.

This is Legacy add-on, so you need original game to be installed (Microsoft Flight Simulator X) or DG-808S (MS version) already imported into your Community folder.
This add-on contain various improvements like modern flight model, working gauges, replaced sounds, updated textures.
Further work will be continued to bring better gauges functionality, visual quality and realistic flight performance.

---------------------

HOW TO INSTALL

Automatic installer support two installation modes: Install (installed Flight Simulator X required) and Update (if you already have DG-808S MS imported into your Community folder)

1. Unpack and launch MSFS_Legacy_DG808S_#.exe files
2. Choose preferable installation method
3. If Install selected, you need to choose Flight Simulator X installation folder (root of it, not DG808 aircraft folder)
4. Regadless selected option, find your MSFS Community folder (if you have problems with that - read this article https://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/content.php?21235-Finding-The-MSFS-2020-Community-Folder ). You can't install add-on in some other folder, or installer will be not able to find file Asobo_VL3.PC.PCK (you will need to copy it into \sound\ manually).
5. Installation process will started, which includes:
5.1 If Install selected, FSX files will be copied into Community folder
5.2 "\sound\" and "\DG808S.air" deleted from aircraft folder, as well as "dg808s_CVT_" from Community
5.3 Asobo_VL3.PC.PCK and Asobo_VL3_AI.PC.PCK copied from "\Official\OneStore\asobo-aircraft-vl3\" or "\Official\Steam\asobo-aircraft-vl3\" folder (depends on installed MSFS version)
5.4 Add-on files extracted into aircraft folder
5.5 msfsJSONgen.exe copied into Community folder
5.6 Converted gauges extracted into "\Community\legacy-vcockpits-instruments\" folder
5.7 JSON file for aircraft and gauges regenerated by msfsJSONgen (black screen pop up)
5.8 Readme.txt file opened if relative option was selected

ISSUES

EXE file of this installer is unsigned, so Windows Defender/some other antivirus software may be triggered. Each update build will be submit into Microsoft Security Intelligence service to make sure it will be not blocked by Windows Defender, but it take days until cloud database, and then your client, will be updated. If you experience such issue – you may try to apply security intelligence manual update following this instruction https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates and then try to run application again.

If you experience "Too long filename" error in installation process, or your Community folder is inside of USERS directory (and as result has really long path name), first of all check that LongPathsEnabled value is equal to "1" in your windows registry https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/

Remove fuel right after game start if you don't need it, or increase amount from 50% to 100%.

If you experience visual issues with yaw string, switch antialiasing settings from TAA to different one.

If you want to disable vario tone, use Alt+A shortkey

LIST OF CONFIG FILES CHANGES

[WEIGHT_AND_BALANCE]

empty_weight = 772 ; (pounds)
empty_weight_cg_position = -2.2693,  0.0, 0.00 ; -1.93 (feet) longitudinal, lateral, vertical distance from specified datum

station_load.0 = 170, 1, 0, -0.5, TT:MENU.PAYLOAD.PILOT, 1
station_load.1 = 0,  4.6797, 0, 0, TT:FRONT BALLAST
station_load.2 = 0, -1.6797, 0, 0, TT:CG BALLAST
station_load.3 = 0, -7.6797, 0, 0, TT:REAR BALLAST 

[FLIGHT_TUNING]
cruise_lift_scalar = 2 ;
parasite_drag_scalar = 0.5 ; 
induced_drag_scalar = 0.5	 ; 
elevator_effectiveness = 1.0 ; 
aileron_effectiveness = 2.0 ; 
rudder_effectiveness = 1.0 ; 

[FLAPS.0]
lift_scalar = 2 ; Scalar coefficient to ponderate global flap lift coef (non dimensioned)
drag_scalar = 0.5 ; Scalar coefficient to ponderate global flap drag coef (non dimensioned)

---------------------

If you also convert the [AERODYNAMICS] section you must correct the aero_center_lift value which must be (negative) approximately 1/4 of the wing_root_chord variable - IF wing_root_chord = 3.03 ; Feet

[AERODYNAMICS]

aero_center_lift = -0.75 ; -9.5 Init to center CA

---------------------

ENGINE - Inserted jet engines, to simulate a towing plane, with only 1 gallon of petrol, if you don't want to use this function just put 0 in the tank variable

[FUEL]
Center1 = -1.6797, 0, 0, 1, 0 ; For each tank: Tank position (z longitudinal, x lateral, y vertical) (FEET), total fuel capacity (GALLONS), unusable fuel capacity (GALLONS)

Edited the file - runway.flt - to have the engine ready when you start from the ground and with the brakes already off

---------------------

SOUND - Used the new MSFS sound of Asobo_VL3.
Inserted the vario sound in the original file - sound.xml - and removed the engine sound, leaving only a sound when the fuel runs out and the engine is switched off, to simulate the sound, of towing release.

---------------------

TEXTURE - Texture changed - dg808s_t.dds - in the position of the glass, to solve the invisible glass problem from the outside view
