description = "The DG-808S Competition is a lightweight, high-performance sailplane constructed with composite materials. It features a sophisticated water ballast system that allows the pilot to tailor wing loading to prevailing weather conditions. In weak thermals, the large surface area of the sailplane�s 59-foot (18-meter) wingspan makes for high lift and good climb performance without ballast. In heavier weather, the DG-808S Competition�s combination of low weight and high strength allows it to take off at more than twice its empty weight with enough ballast to soar in strong thermals. In all conditions, its upswept winglets increase the sailplane�s already excellent glide ratio." ; Variation description.
