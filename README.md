# FSX DG808S upgrade to MSFS

## Things to do

* Implement TE for Winter vario, inject TE into sim as SimVar

* Make Polar Analysis tool using simconnect (another repo), similar to [B21 Analysis](https://github.com/xp-soaring/B21_Analysis)

* Get DG808S polar correct at zero flap

* get flaps working (i.e. with correct polar)

* get water ballast working (i.e. with correct polar) (water dump effect possible?)

* Implement Netto on Cambridge 302 vario

* Implement Speed-to-Fly on Cambridge 302 vario (auto-switch Netto / STF thermal/cruise?)

* Implement NAV on panel, using flightplan.

## Some development pointers

### Simconnect

* [Simconnect from Golang: lian](https://github.com/lian/msfs2020-go)
